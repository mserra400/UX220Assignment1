# My Research
- The article Goal Setting and Student Achievement: A Longitudinal Study explains how students' lack of ownership in learning occurs when students do not commit themselves to a task or fail to understand its purpose. I see a direct correlation between this statement and my life involving achieving goals. I am not someone who often sets daily or even long-term goals. I enjoy going with the flow and taking everything one step at a time. This can be problematic though because I tend to not fully understand how important certain achievements I need to accomplish are and sometimes do not produce my best work. The article also states that making connections between students' goals and learning tasks boosts the task's value and, as a result, increases motivation. My takeaway from this article is that I should be setting goals every day, even if they are small so that I can be more motivated to achieve success in my life.
